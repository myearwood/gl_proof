- analyzed the best GL Square generated (10 sums), and we found theres hetrogenous outcomes among the class. Some of them are invalid, and 400 of them are best in the class. 

    - next research direction: Identifying the negative cases (0s and duplicates.)

    - see if there are any commonalities in the success cases.
